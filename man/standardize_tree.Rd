\title{Standardizes branch lengths for a single tree
For a single tree, divides each branch length by the sum of branch lengths or 
maximum branch length for that tree.}
\usage{
standardize_tree(tree, denom = "branch_sum")
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The tree of interest.}

\item{denom}{The quantity to standardize by. Default is \code{branch_sum}, which is
the sum of branch lengths in that tree. The other option is \code{max_branch}, which
will divide each branch length by the maximum branch length in that tree.}
}
\value{
The standardized tree.
}
