\title{Standardizes branch lengths
Divides each branch length by the sum of branch lengths or maximum branch length
for that tree or sets each branch length to \code{1}.}
\usage{
standardize_branches(tree, denom = "branch_sum")
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The tree or set of trees of interest.}

\item{denom}{The quantity to standardize by. Default is \code{branch_sum}, which is
the sum of branch lengths in that tree. Another option is \code{max_branch}, which
will divide each branch length by the maximum branch length in that tree. The last 
option is \code{one}, which recodes all branches to have length \code{1}.}
}
\value{
The standardized tree or set of trees.
}
